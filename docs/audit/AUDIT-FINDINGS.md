# NeoEthos workspace audit — findings ledger

**Started**: 2026-05-24
**Methodology**: read each file ΟΛΟΚΛΗΡΟ. For every finding, document:
- File + line range
- What's wrong (or smells wrong)
- Why it matters (which downstream lies because of it)
- Proposed fix (NOT applied — collect first, batch later)
- Severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

**Build policy**: do NOT compile per-finding. Single workspace build at the END.

# Findings

## eval.rs — `crates/neoethos-search/src/eval.rs` (1211 lines, **COMPLETE**)

### F-001 (HIGH) — `BacktestMetrics` has abandoned slot at array index 7
- **Location**: lines 167-200
- **What**: `from_metric_array` jumps from `metrics[6]` directly to `metrics[8]`. `to_metric_array` writes literal `0.0` at index 7.
- **Why it matters**: 11-element array → 10 fields. Index 7 is a phantom slot. Any caller that builds a `[f64; 11]` manually thinking index 7 is data gets `0.0` silently. Magic-position bug.
- **Fix**: convert to named struct field round-trip instead of positional array. Or shrink to `[f64; 10]`. Decide based on whether any caller relies on the 11-element shape.
- **Severity**: HIGH (data corruption risk if anyone hand-rolls metric arrays)

### F-002 (CRITICAL) — `BacktestSettings::default()` uses synthetic EURUSD cost-profile
- **Location**: lines 215-244
- **What**: `Default::default()` calls `infer_market_cost_profile("", "", None, None, None)` which falls back to EURUSD pip math on USD account.
- **Why it matters**: any caller that constructs `BacktestSettings::default()` then runs an actual backtest is using FAKE spreads/commissions. MaxDD/Sharpe numbers from those paths are unreliable. This is the ROOT of bug #214 — fixing the validation harness was surface-level.
- **Real callers** (verified via grep, all run real evaluation):
  - `crates/neoethos-search/src/discovery.rs:710` (struct-update spread — verify field overrides)
  - `crates/neoethos-search/src/gauntlet.rs:60`
  - `crates/neoethos-search/src/parity.rs:217`
  - `crates/neoethos-search/src/eval.rs:1152, 1181` (tests — likely fine)
- **Fix**: see F-003.
- **Severity**: CRITICAL

### F-003 (CRITICAL) — `BacktestSettings::for_symbol` referenced in doc but DOES NOT EXIST
- **Location**: `eval.rs:218-224` comment says "Every backtest entry point should pass a real symbol via `for_symbol(...)`"
- **What**: `grep -rn "fn for_symbol" crates/` returns ZERO matches in `BacktestSettings`. The method is referenced as the migration target but was never implemented. A sibling struct `EvaluationConfig` at `crates/neoethos-search/src/genetic/strategy_gene.rs:582` DOES have `for_symbol` with the correct pattern — that's the template.
- **Why it matters**: Phantom API. A TODO that points to nothing. The fix path that the original author documented was never taken. This is exactly the user's complaint about "code that exists but is not properly tied together".
- **Fix**:
  1. Add `BacktestSettings::for_symbol(symbol, account_currency, price_hint, spread_override, commission_override) -> Self` mirroring `EvaluationConfig::for_symbol`.
  2. Migrate 3 production callers (`discovery.rs:710`, `gauntlet.rs:60`, `parity.rs:217`).
  3. Update `Default::default()` doc to say "tests-only; production paths must use `for_symbol`".
- **Severity**: CRITICAL — fixes F-002 root cause.

### F-004 (MEDIUM) — Two parallel backtest implementations (drift risk)
- **Location**: `fast_evaluate_strategy_core` lines 332-616 AND `simulate_trades_core`-like (no explicit fn name visible, lines 700-905) inside the same file
- **What**: Two near-identical loops doing the same backtest: same entry causality, same SL/TP geometry, same kill-zone gates. Only difference: the second variant returns per-trade `Trade` records (for journaling). Both reference the "Bug #1 fix: half-spread at entry" pattern, suggesting they were synced once but there is no compile-time guarantee they stay in sync.
- **Why it matters**: When a bug is found in one (e.g. the historical intra-bar lookahead that was fixed at line 595 of `fast_evaluate_strategy_core`), the other path may silently keep the bug. Two separate stores of "what is a trade?" can drift.
- **Fix**: extract the per-bar simulation loop into a single `step` function called by both. Each variant only differs in whether it accumulates a `Trade` record. Estimated refactor ~150 LOC delta, no behavior change.
- **Severity**: MEDIUM (no immediate correctness bug; latent drift risk)

### F-005 (LOW) — `FOREX_BOT_DISABLE_SMC_GATE` env var hidden bypass
- **Location**: lines 947-951 + same pattern in `genetic/search_engine.rs:261`
- **What**: setting this env to "1"/"true"/"TRUE" silently bypasses the SMC indicator gate (sets `active_sum = 0`). Documented in the comment as "Lets operators isolate ... without recompiling".
- **Why it matters**: behavior changes invisibly based on environment. A trader who set this once and forgot will get different results from someone who didn't. No log line announces the bypass.
- **Fix**: at startup, if any `FOREX_BOT_*` env var is set, log a single `tracing::warn!` listing them so the operator can see what's been overridden.
- **Severity**: LOW

### F-006 (NOTE) — `init_rayon` IS wired (false alarm)
- **Location**: defined `eval.rs:40`, called `eval.rs:1016` from `evaluate_population_core`
- **What**: my initial suspicion that `init_rayon` was disconnected was wrong. It IS called from the public eval entrypoint.
- **Severity**: NONE — verification only.

# Sessions
- **2026-05-24 session 1**: scaffolded ledger; audited eval.rs COMPLETE (1211/1211 lines); surfaced F-001, F-002, F-003, F-004, F-005, F-006. Critical findings: F-002 + F-003 are the root cause of bug #214 (cost-model with empty symbol). Fixes deferred to "batch implementation" phase per user directive: build only once at end.

## Next session targets
- `crates/neoethos-search/src/discovery.rs` (2900 lines) — the orchestrator
- `crates/neoethos-search/src/validation.rs` (1855 lines) — CPCV / forward-test
- `crates/neoethos-search/src/genetic/search_engine.rs`
- `crates/neoethos-search/src/genetic/strategy_gene.rs` (contains the `for_symbol` template to mirror)
- … then continue priority list
