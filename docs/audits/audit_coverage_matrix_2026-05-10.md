# Audit coverage matrix — 2026-05-10

Cross-references every source audit under `docs/audits/` against the
Phase 1-70 follow-on slice. Built after Phase 70 closure to identify
what still has actionable items the consolidated plan
(`ALL_AUDITS_CONSOLIDATED_2026-05-06.md`) marked but did not land.

Postscript: Phases 72-75 landed the quick-win bucket this matrix originally
recommended: Python/PyO3 guardrail, `allow(dead_code)` audit, indicator
registry metadata, and registry validation surface.

Postscript 2: Phases 76-79 landed the typed model runtime propagation slice
for `PredictionMetadata`, NEAT, CRFMNES / neuro-evolution, statistical linear
models, and swarm forecasting results. Legacy string fields remain for
backward compatibility, but new writes now carry typed `BackendKind`,
`RuntimeMode`, and degraded-reason metadata where this slice touched artifacts.

Postscript 3: Phases 80-85 cleaned up the stale `forex-models` contract test
failures that remained after typed propagation. The slice hardened Burn/deep
runtime provenance, exit-agent trained-artifact reports, streaming Hoeffding
runtime details, and RL fallback/runtime contracts; the forex-models lib suite
is green at 335 tests after this cleanup.

Postscript 4: Phase 86 landed the training-model artifact producer. Every
`training_orchestrator` model save now writes a typed
`TrainingModelArtifactContract` envelope beside the runtime profile, with
artifact provenance, dataset fingerprint, feature/label/runtime hashes, backend
kind, runtime mode, device assignment, hardware profile id, and source commit.

Postscript 5: Phase 87 deduplicated high-confidence repo JSON artifact IO.
`forex_core::storage::json` now owns atomic writes, backup writes, typed reads,
temporary artifact paths, and stable hashes; `forex-search::artifact_io` became
a compatibility re-export and common `forex-models` metadata/artifact writers
now use the shared helper. The same slice also moved tree-model JSON sidecars
and swarm forecaster JSON save/load onto the core-backed helpers, leaving local
file writers only for binary/raw payloads and test corruption fixtures.

Postscript 6: Phase 88 closed the `forex_models_functional` ONNX legacy
boundary by moving `ONNXInferenceEngine` out of `lib.rs` into
`runtime::onnx`, keeping only a feature-gated crate-root re-export.

Postscript 7: Phase 89 closed the `model_runtime_backend_fragmentation`
bridge gap by wiring `forex-models` staged training persistence to emit a
typed `ModelRuntimeArtifact<TrainingRuntimeProfile>` sidecar and by sharing
the training/model-runtime provenance builder.

`✅` = addressed by the listed phase(s); `🟡` = partially addressed;
`🔴` = not addressed yet (actionable gap).

## Actionable gaps grouped by impact

### High-leverage, low-risk (landed in Phases 72-75)

- **CI guardrail for Python/PyO3 reintroduction** (#21): landed in
  Phase 72 via `scripts/check_no_python_legacy.sh` and CI wiring.
- **`allow(dead_code)` audit** (#6): landed in Phase 73 via
  `dead_code_allowlist_2026-05-10.md`; the stale `SessionAccum`
  suppression was removed.
- **Indicator registry metadata** (#12): landed in Phases 74-75 via
  `forex-data::core::feature_registry` and `FeatureFrame` registry
  validation helpers.

### Medium-leverage, medium-risk

- **Typed model runtime propagation** (#10, #17, #19): landed in
  Phases 76-79 for `PredictionMetadata`, NEAT, CRFMNES /
  neuro-evolution, statistical linear artifacts, CUDA linear fit
  results, and swarm forecast results.
- **Training-model artifact producer** (#31): landed in Phase 86 through
  the staged `training_orchestrator` persistence path.
- **Streaming / RL runtime metadata** (#13): landed across Phases 76,
  79, and 80-85. Phase 88 closed the remaining ONNX legacy boundary.
- **Model-runtime artifact bridge** (#19): landed in Phase 89 through
  `model_runtime_artifact.json` sidecars emitted by staged
  `training_orchestrator` saves.

### Larger / deferred

- **UI hardware/runtime panel** (#18, P2-1). Out-of-scope for the
  contract layer; needs the egui side to consume the scheduler-owned
  plans.
- **Indicator-level CPU/GPU parity tests** (#16). Phase 4 covered the
  population evaluator; statistical / evolution backends need their
  own parity fixtures.
- **Large-file split deeper than Phase 6** (#3). Training orchestrator,
  ensemble.rs, exit_agent.rs are still large. Splitting risks behavior
  drift; defer until contract tests cover the affected surfaces.

## Recommendation

The contract / validation / extraction work that occupied Phases 1-70
is complete. The gaps above split into three buckets:

1. **Quick wins (Phases 72-75)**: landed. CI guardrail,
   `allow(dead_code)` audit, indicator registry metadata, and registry
   validation surface are now in the follow-on log.
2. **Typed propagation (Phases 76-79)**: landed for the model result
   surfaces listed above. Remaining model work should now focus on RL /
   streaming routing and artifact producers rather than another broad
   string-to-enum sweep.
3. **Deferred infrastructure (no phase)**: UI exposure, parity tests
   for statistical/evolution backends, CUDA discovery VRAM budget ledger,
   and large-file splits. Each needs its own design pass before landing —
   out of scope for a routine follow-on slice.

The next concrete slice should pick one deferred infrastructure gap with a
tight design boundary before changing behavior.
